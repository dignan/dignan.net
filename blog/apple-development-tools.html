      <p>During the brief available time I had to myself over the past October break, I decided to take a look at some of Apple's development tools.  In particular, I wanted to re-investigate iPhone app development.</p>

      <p>There are often times when I think about an iPhone app that would be great to write, but I never actually have the time or knowledge of the platform to make my thoughts into an actual app.  So over the break I did more research into the platform to try to uncover some of the logic behind it and the ways the tools are intended to be used.</p>

      <p>One thing that became very clear to me is that Apple has put an incredible amount of thought into the design of their programming platform.  The tools provided with Xcode are superb.  Perhaps the clearest example of this is how easy Apple makes it to utilize some common design patterns.  For example, the MVC pattern, perhaps the most basic and common pattern, is very easily implemented using Interface Builder and Xcode's Core Data modeling tools.</p>
     
      <p>It is possible and simple to create an application in which no model or view code is written, so the programmer can focus on getting things done by writing the controller code.  Interface Builder is a nice tool for creating iPhone application interfaces, and allows for clear separation of the different windows an iPhone app may have.  The Xcode Core Data modeling tool allows a programmer to design a data model in a graphical way that shows the relationships between different objects.  These two aspects are very simply linked up to appropriate controller code, and the application is ready to go.</p>

      <p>It's truly a shame that these tools cannot be leveraged to develop cross-platform programs.  As a user of various Linux distributions and Mac OS X, anything I write is likely to be usable on at least those platforms, as well as Windows.  iPhone apps are an exception to that generality as the iPhone is a unique platform to develop for.</p>
