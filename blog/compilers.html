      <p>I have begun initial research into creating a programming language.  I am working with a friend of mine, Irving.  Thus far, I have begun reading the excellent Modern Compiler Design by David Galles.  Modern Compiler Design manages to make something which may seem very dry, like compiler design, very interesting.</p>

      <p>Compilers are a fascinating subject.  Many programmers seem to consider them a sort of "black magic" which somehow makes our code work.  The fact that I know almost nothing about how compilers work is essentially the reason I decided to take on this project.</p>
     
      <p>While learning about the basics of compiler design, I have come to realize just how many topics are integrated into compiler design.  For example, one could apply graph theory to making the deterministic finite automata that make up the parser module of the compier, or how linguistic concerns can enter the design of the grammar the compiler will use.</p>
